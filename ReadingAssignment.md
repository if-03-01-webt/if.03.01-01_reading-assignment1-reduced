### IF.03.01 Basic Web Techniques -- Winter 2017
# Assignment 1: Reading Assignment

## Objective
The first week's assignment is to get you familiar with a few basic terms concerning the world wide web (WWW) and Hypertext Markup Language (html).

## Materials
Review the [handouts](IntroductionHandout.pdf) of the last lecture (what is basically a summary of the presentation shown) and check the resources as given in the following sections.

### Word Wide Web General
1. Wikipedia article about World Wide Web. Read the [history section](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web#History) and here focus especially on the three essential technologies
2. Wikipedia article about the unified resource locator. Read the [general introduction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URL) and the [section about the syntax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URL#Syntax)

### Web Server
The Wikipedia article on web servers. Concentrate on the [Overview section](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_server#Overview).

### Web Client
Wikipedia article on web browsers. Just read the [general introduction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_browser) and the [section about their function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_browser#Function)

### Hello World
1. [About DOCTYPE](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_doctype.asp)
2. [About the body element](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_body.asp)
2. [About the em element](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_em.asp)
2. [About the head element](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_head.asp)
2. [About the html element](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_html.asp)
2. [About the strong element](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_strong.asp)
2. [About the title element](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_title.asp)

## Required Tasks
1. Read the materials presented above.
2. Create an html document called ``CheatSheet.html`` and store it into your assignment repository. The document should contain the following items:
   1. A ``DOCTYPE`` declaration
   2. An ``<html>`` element on top level
   3. A ``<head>`` element with a meta information concerning the character encoding and a title.
   4. A ``<body>`` element
3. Cheat Sheet: For each item you read and which you think that helps you to answer the questions in [SampleQuestions.md](SampleQuestions.md) create a paragraph in your file (``CheatSheet.html``).
4. Pull Request: As soon as you are finished with your cheat sheet, make a pull request that your file is getting graded.

We will do a quiz during one of the next lessons where you can prove that you read the given texts carefully. For this quiz and all the following ones you can use your CheatSheet.

## Hint
- A sample entry of your cheat sheet should look like as follows:
```html
<p>
      <strong>meta</strong> &lt;meta charset="utf8" /&gt;
</p>
```
Of course you can also use `<em>` instead of `<strong>`. Just check your file in the browser and see what you like most.
- Take care that your code is formatted properly. Do indentations when you start a new element inside another element.

## Evaluation
When you make a pull request your cheat sheet will be graded. Most common reasons to mark down a solution would be
- One or more of the *Required Tasks* section are not satisified
- Submitted code is visually sloppy and hard to read

## Extra Credits
Give brief answers to the questions given in the file [SampleQuestions.md](SampleQuestions.md). When you make a pull request you will get feedback on your proposed answers and some extra points on the first quiz.
